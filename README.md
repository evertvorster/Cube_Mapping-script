# Cube_Mapping-script
Script for cutting equi-rectangular environment maps into images suitable for cube maps.

This script can reside anywhere on your path. It generates a few files in the directory that it is called from. 

These files can be pulled into a cube map.

Here is a short video on how this is achieved:

The script flips the images to ensure that they are suitable for the cube maps in Vega Strike. 
Should you want to utilize the cube face pictures for something other than Vega Strike you might have to comment 
out the magick part of the script.
